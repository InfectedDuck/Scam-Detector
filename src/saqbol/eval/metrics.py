"""T502 — evaluation metrics, bootstrap intervals and annotator agreement.

Pure functions over label arrays. Nothing here imports the pipeline, opens a
socket or knows what a message looks like, because a number that can only be
produced by running the whole system is a number nobody can check by hand, and
every figure in the report has to be checkable by hand.

Four decisions here are worth defending rather than reading past.

**Bootstrap intervals are stratified by the true class.** An unstratified
resample of 148 rows will, often enough to matter, contain none of the four
`kz.mule_account_rental` items, and macro-F1 over a label set that lost a class
is not the same statistic as macro-F1 over the label set we reported. Drawing
within each true class, preserving that class's count, keeps every resample
comparable to the point estimate. The cost is that the interval covers sampling
noise *given* the class balance, not noise in the class balance itself, which
is the right trade for a fixed benchmark split.

**Undefined is not zero.** A class absent from both the gold labels and the
predictions has no F1, and a pair of annotators who both used a single category
have no kappa: chance agreement is already total, so the statistic carries no
information. Those cases return `nan` and are excluded from the macro average
rather than being scored 0.0 and quietly punishing a system for a class the
split could never have tested. `nan` prints as a dash in the leaderboard; 0.0
prints as a failure that never happened.

**Ties in the risk-coverage curve break pessimistically.** A system that emits
three distinct confidence values has large tied blocks, and the area under the
curve would otherwise depend on the order rows happened to arrive in. Errors
rank ahead of correct answers inside a tie, so the reported curve is the worst
ordering consistent with the confidences the system actually produced.

**No comparison without separation.** `overlaps`, `compare` and `beats` are the
only sanctioned way to phrase one system against another, and `beats` raises
rather than returning a sentence when the intervals touch. The README promises
that rule; a promise enforced by a function is a promise, and one enforced by
remembering is a hope.

The bootstrap is the percentile method, not BCa. For macro-F1 over several
hundred rows the difference sits well inside the interval's own width, and the
percentile method is the one a reader can reimplement from the description.
